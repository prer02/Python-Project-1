# Python-Project:
# *Project Overview:*

This Python project explores the California Housing Dataset. The dataset provides information on various features related to housing in California, derived from the 1990 U.S. census. The dataset includes details such as longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, median house value, and ocean proximity.

The dataset consists of following features:

1) longitude-The datatype is numerical and a continuous data    
2) latitude- The datatype is numerical and also is a continuous data
3) housing_median_age- Quantitative type-Discrete data
4) total_rooms- Quantitative type-Discrete data
5) total_bedrooms-Quantitative type-Discrete data
6) population- Quantitative type-Discrete data
7) households- Quantitative type-Discrete data
8) median_income-Quantitative type- Continuous data 
9) median_house_value-Quantitative type-Discrete data 
10) ocean_proximity-Quantitative type-Nominal data  



# *Addressed the following questions:*

1. What is the average median income of the data set and check the distribution of data using appropriate plots. Please explain the distribution of the plot.
2. Draw an appropriate plot to see the distribution of housing_median_age and explain your observations.
3. Show with the help of visualization, how median_income and median_house_values are related?
4. Create a data set by deleting the corresponding examples from the data set for which total_bedrooms are not available.
5. Create a data set by filling the missing data with the mean value of the total_bedrooms in the original data set.
6. Write a programming construct (create a user defined function) to calculate the median value of the data set wherever required.
7. Plot latitude versus longitude and explain your observations.
8. Create a data set for which the ocean_proximity is ‘Near ocean’.
9. Find the mean and median of the median income for the data set created in question 8.
10. Please create a new column named total_bedroom_size. If the total bedrooms is 10 or less, it should be quoted as small. If the total bedrooms is 11 or more but less than 1000, it should be medium, otherwise it should be considered large.
